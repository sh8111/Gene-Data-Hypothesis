# Gene Datasets Hypothesis Exploration

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `gene-datasets-hypothesis.ipynb`, which explores gene expression datasets to identify meaningful relationships and test biological hypotheses. The analysis involves data loading, cleaning, visualization, and statistical testing.

## Contents
- **gene-datasets-hypothesis.ipynb**: The main notebook containing exploratory data analysis, hypothesis formulation, and testing on gene datasets.
- **Data Source**: The notebook demonstrates how to load gene expression data (datasets referenced within the notebook).
- **Visualizations**: Includes plots and charts that reveal correlations and patterns between different gene expression levels.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Contains hypothesis testing using t-tests and ANOVA to identify significant differences between gene groups.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visual exploration using scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps.
- Correlation analysis between selected genes.
- Formulation and testing of hypotheses.
- Conclusions based on statistical significance.

## How to Run
